# Automated Testing Project - Autoro Mutual


This project is a set of automated tests developed in Java with Selenium and Cucumber for the Autoro Mutual system. The test system used is a demo version hosted at [demo.testfire.net](https://demo.testfire.net/). The group responsible for the project consists of four people: Khaterin Palomino, Victor Ramalho, Karine Rodrigues, and Rodrigo Freitas.


## Project Objective


The objective of this project is to perform automated tests to ensure the quality and stability of the Autoro Mutual system. We use the Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) technique with the Cucumber framework, allowing more effective communication between stakeholders and a living documentation of the system requirements.


## Technologies Used


- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- Cucumber

## Page Objects

We follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to create a structured and maintainable test automation framework. Page Objects help encapsulate the interaction with web elements on each page, making the code more readable and reducing duplication.

## ExtentReports

For reporting, we utilize **ExtentReports**, a powerful library that allows us to create beautiful, interactive, and detailed reports for our tests. With ExtentReports, we can add events, screenshots, tags, devices, authors, or any other relevant information to create descriptive and stunning reports. We have customized our reports to include essential details such as application under test, environment, machine information, and more.
