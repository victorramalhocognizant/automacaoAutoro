# Automated Testing Project - Autoro Mutual

This project serves as a practice ground for applying knowledge in Selenium, Java, and Cucumber. It allows us to hone our skills during bench time. The test system used is a demo version hosted at [demo.testfire.net](https://demo.testfire.net/). The project team includes four members: Khaterin Palomino, Victor Ramalho, Karine Rodrigues, and Rodrigo Freitas.


## Project Objective


The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience in automated testing by working with Selenium WebDriver, Java, and Cucumber. We aim to create robust and maintainable test scripts while ensuring the quality and stability of the Autoro Mutual system.

[![Cucumber](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Cucumber-23CE6B?logo=cucumber&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://cucumber.io/)

## Page Objects

We follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to create a structured and maintainable test automation framework. Page Objects help encapsulate the interaction with web elements on each page, making the code more readable and reducing duplication.

## ExtentReports

For reporting, we utilize **ExtentReports**, a powerful library that allows us to create beautiful, interactive, and detailed reports for our tests. With ExtentReports, we can add events, screenshots, tags, devices, authors, or any other relevant information to create descriptive and stunning reports. We have customized our reports to include essential details such as application under test, environment, machine information, and more.
